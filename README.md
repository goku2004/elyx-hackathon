Elyx Hackathon Project

🚀 Overview
This project simulates personalized health journeys for Elyx Life members.
It has two major parts:
Conversation Simulator → Generates WhatsApp-style chats between the member (Rohan Patel) and the Elyx team (Ruby, Dr. Warren, Advik, Carla, Rachel, Neel).
Journey Dashboard → A web app to visualize the member’s 8-month journey, interventions, and reasoning behind each decision.

The goal is to show how AI/LLMs can support proactive health management by generating realistic interactions and transparent “why” explanations for medical/lifestyle interventions.
